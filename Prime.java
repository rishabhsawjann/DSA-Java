/*
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has only two factors:

ðŸ‘‰ 1 and itself

That means it cannot be divided evenly (without remainder) by any other number.

âœ… Examples of prime numbers:

2 â†’ factors = (1, 2) âœ” prime

3 â†’ factors = (1, 3) âœ” prime

5 â†’ factors = (1, 5) âœ” prime

7 â†’ factors = (1, 7) âœ” prime

âš¡ Special note:

1 is NOT prime (because it has only one factor, itself).

2 is the only even prime (all other even numbers are divisible by 2).
