// this is the program for finding the greatest common factor between two numbers
/*
Highest Common Factor) of two numbers is the biggest number
that divides both numbers completely (without leaving a remainder).
ðŸ‘‰ Example:

Numbers: 12 and 18

Factors of 12 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}

Factors of 18 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18}

Common factors = {1, 2, 3, 6}

Greatest common factor = 6 âœ…
