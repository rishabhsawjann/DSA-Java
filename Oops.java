// Now we will study about opps in detail which is very important topic 
/*
for example your teacher asks you I want you to store the roll number of 5 students
you will say no problem ma'am 
int  num[] =new int[5];// we can do it by making a intger array
and now your teacher asks you to store 5 names
String name[]=new String[5]
you teacher asks you to store the data of 5 students
roll number,name and marks
int  num[] =new int[5];
String name[]=new String[5];
float marks[]=new float[5];

but instead this we can also make our own datatypes:

Student[] students=new Students[5];

//so this how would I do it 

class Student //creating a class
{
   int  num;
String name;
float marks;

}

class is a templates of objects 
and object is the instance of the class 
you can take the car class 

what are instance variables: variables inside the objects are called instance variables


what is the dot operator
